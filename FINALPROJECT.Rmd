# Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the interplay between physical activity, nutrition, and their impacts on health outcomes such as obesity, cardiovascular fitness, and overall well-being. This data science project aims to explore trends and insights related to these critical areas by leveraging real-world data from the Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This dataset, collected through comprehensive surveys, provides valuable information on diet, physical activity, and weight status across different demographics and geographic locations.

The primary objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships between exercise habits, dietary choices, and health metrics. By analyzing this data, we aim to answer questions such as:
	•	How do physical activity levels vary across different populations?
	•	What is the relationship between exercise frequency and obesity rates?
	•	Are there significant regional differences in physical activity and nutrition trends?

The insights derived from this analysis have the potential to inform public health policies, guide community wellness programs, and raise awareness about the importance of healthy lifestyle choices. This project not only highlights the utility of data-driven approaches in addressing societal health challenges but also provides an opportunity to deepen our understanding of how daily habits influence long-term health outcomes.
